### Tensorflow exploration projects

1. [Tensorflow Simple Array Addition](Tensorflow_simple_array_addition.py) -- Initial exploratory prject using tensorflow on a Windows 10 machine. Receives two arrays as inputs, then calculates and displays the result of adding the two arrays. Part of the *'AI and Machine Learning Specialist, Part II'* Learning Path on LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com).
2. [Game Earnings Prediction](https://github.com/AlinLucian/Data-Science-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Earnings%20Prediction) -- Master folder for the Game Earnings Prediction Project which is the main focus of the *'AI and Machine Learning Specialist, Part II'* Learning Path on LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com). Raw data used can be found in files: sales_data_test.csv and sales_data_training.csv. _Note: data has been pre-cleaned_
     - [Pre-loading the data](https://github.com/AlinLucian/Data-Science-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Earnings%20Prediction/Load_data.py) -- initial data exploration,scaling, and loading using the pandas framework
     - [Game Earnings Prediction Model](https://github.com/AlinLucian/Data-Science-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Earnings%20Prediction/Game_Earnings_Prediction_Model.py) -- Loads data from test and training files as pandas frameworks, defines the neural network, runs the training session, logs theoptimization progress so that progress can be viewed via TensorBoard, and saves the trained model for later use. _Python libraries used: scikit=learn; pandas _
